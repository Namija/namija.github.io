          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a California native and a student in the class of 2024 at Dartmouth College, 
            working on a BA in Japanese with a minor in Digital Art. I worked as a Game Design 
            Intern at Resonym/Tilt Factor in New Hampshire last summer and am currently developing 
            my skills with Dartmouth's offerings in digital and game design. Most recently, I 
            completed an 
            <a href="http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Computer-Science/COSC-Computer-Science-Undergraduate/COSC-22" target="_blank">
              introductory course
            </a> 
            in Maya and I am currently enrolled in a 
            <a href="http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Computer-Science/COSC-Computer-Science-Undergraduate/COSC-23-01" target="_blank">
              continuation of this course
            </a> 
            organized around level design in AR/VR games developed in Unity. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy baking, watching soccer, reading history, traveling, and 
            playing games (especially Pokemon, Dark Souls, and Minecraft). Game design, 
            particularly level and content design, is a favorite hobby of mine and one I have 
            been pursuing since I started running D&D games for my friends and siblings in middle 
            school. In my work I seek to instill a sense of warmth and wonder while remaining 
            honest to the topic I want to address.

          <h1>MAYA</h1>
          <p>
            In Fall 2022, I completed a course in introductory 3D-modeling at Dartmouth College. 
            This course covered hard surface as well as basic organic modeling, Adobe Substance 
            Painter, lighting, rendering, and animation. For each of these projects I worked 
            from concept images through multiple re-renders. All modeling, lighting, and UV 
            mapping was performed by me.

          <h1>WorldMachine/Bannerlord</h1>
          <p>
            Mount and Blade: Warband is one of my most played games on Steam, 
            and much of this playtime is thanks to the wonderful work of the 
            modding community. When Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord came out in 
            early access, I realized it would be a good opportunity to develop 
            my own skills as a scene designer. I taught myself the node-based 
            terrain generation software WorldMachine, which I used to design a 
            map with an emphasis on natural realism and a balance between open 
            and tight spaces in which battles could take place.
          </p>
          <p>
            For my River Valley map, I used reference images of Malibu Creek 
            State Park by my home in California and drew out the simple geometry 
            of the mountains and river using shape nodes. I applied perlin and 
            voronoi noises to these features to create rough surfaces before 
            applying a ground level and river course. I then used multiple layers 
            of erosion to carve out the river banks and create natural looking 
            slopes for the mountains and valley. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I exported heightmap layers that I used to generate terrain in the 
            Bannerlord Level Editor, where I used more heightmaps to paint 
            terrain efficiently and quickly. I then went through the map and 
            painted foliage by hand while incorporating structures, smoothing 
            terrain, and building an immersive map boundary. Finally, I painted 
            a Navigation Mesh for the CPU soldiers to follow, playing close 
            attention to the two river crossings that I knew would be key 
            features of players' tactics.

            “<a href="https://lockalook.itch.io/caged-beasts-browser-version" target="_blank">
              Caged Beasts
            </a>” started as an itch.io October RPGMaker Game Jam that I 
            undertook with a friend and fellow Dartmouth student. We divided the 
            work between us with my teammate writing the story, me designing the 
            maps and incorporating everything into RPGMakerMV, and both of us 
            collaborating on the chase scenes and puzzles. Of the content, I 
            designed the hedge garden chase scene, the werewolf chase scene, and 
            the mechanical component puzzle on the first floor. I also sourced 
            plug-ins, sprites and other assets, chose music and sound effects, 
            and animated cutscenes according to my teammate's dialogue and blocking. 
            I have since continued to update/patch the game, including introducing 
            a browser-playable version.
          </p>

            I made “

              Heike Tale

            ” in RPGMakerMV as my final demo for the

            </a> 
            course I completed in Spring 2022. This RPG was my attempt at 
            making an immersive and historically honest portrayal of the Medieval 
            Japanese epic Tale of the Heike. The demo contains a single dungeon 
            based on a few starting chapters, and showcases puzzles, combat, 
            cutscenes, and period architecture and sprites.
