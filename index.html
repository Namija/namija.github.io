            <p>
              I'm a California native and a student in the class of 2024 at Dartmouth College, working on a BA in Japanese with a minor in Digital Art. I worked as a Game Design Intern at Resonym/Tilt Factor in New Hampshire last summer and am currently developing my skills with Dartmouth's offerings in digital and game design. Most recently, I completed an

              In my free time, I enjoy baking, watching soccer, reading history, traveling, and playing games (especially Pokemon, Dark Souls, and Minecraft). Game design, particularly level and content design, is a favorite hobby of mine and one I have been pursuing since I started running D&D games for my friends and siblings in middle school. In my work I seek to instill a sense of warmth and wonder while remaining honest to the topic I want to address.

            <p>
              During my time at Dartmouth I have worked on a number of Unity projects, most involving AR/VR functionality. For "Mad King's Descent", the project shown below, I worked on a team of 4 as lead artist and project creator. A full play-through video is available on my ArtStation.

              "Mad King's Descent" is a Gothic horror VR game in which the player takes on the role of a king who enters into a pact with dark powers beyond his comprehension. In terms of setting and gameplay, this story was meant to pay homage to classic RPG horror games of the early 2010s.

              As lead artist, I modeled, textured, and integrated lighting for everything shown below. I also did texturing and lighting for many assets modeled by the other artist on my team. I set deadlines for the team, defined the artistic direction of the game, helped with all aspects of the asset production pipeline, and managed production tasks such as sourcing audio, finding a voice actor, and managing equipment for our live demo at Dartmouth's Spring 2023 Technigala. All textures used were sourced from free online resources or hand illustrated by another artist on the team.

              I also created a number of shaders in Unity, ranging from a sea of fog to the liquid in a bubbling cauldron. This process was self-directed and involved consulting a number of online tutorials from which I could draw my favorite elements.

              In Fall 2022, I completed a course in introductory 3D-modeling at Dartmouth College. This course covered hard surface as well as basic organic modeling, Adobe Substance Painter, lighting, rendering, and animation. For each of these projects I worked from concept images through multiple re-renders. All modeling, lighting, and UV mapping was performed by me.

            <p>
              Mount and Blade: Warband is one of my most played games on Steam, and much of this playtime is thanks to the wonderful work of the modding community. When Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord came out in early access, I realized it would be a good opportunity to develop my own skills as a scene designer. I taught myself the node-based terrain generation software WorldMachine, which I used to design a map with an emphasis on natural realism and a balance between open and tight spaces in which battles could take place.

              For my River Valley map, I used reference images of Malibu Creek State Park by my home in California and drew out the simple geometry of the mountains and river using shape nodes. I applied perlin and voronoi noises to these features to create rough surfaces before applying a ground level and river course. I then used multiple layers of erosion to carve out the river banks and create natural looking slopes for the mountains and valley.

            <img class="modal-img" src="assets/media/bannerlord/bl_nodes.png" alt="Bannerlord heightmap" />
            <p>
              I exported heightmap layers that I used to generate terrain in the Bannerlord Level Editor, where I used more heightmaps to paint terrain efficiently and quickly. I then went through the map and painted foliage by hand while incorporating structures, smoothing terrain, and building an immersive map boundary. Finally, I painted a Navigation Mesh for the CPU soldiers to follow, paying close attention to the two river crossings that I knew would be key features of players' tactics.

              An example of paint layers. I selected the surface textures and foliage type<wbr>/density<wbr>/colony size before applying the texture to a heightmap exported from WorldMachine, which would paint that texture over select areas of the map. I then edited by hand to clean up boundaries and fine-tune realism such as by adding puddles and paths.

              Here are two projects I made using the MV installation of the RPGMaker franchise. For both projects, I used premade tile assets to build and layout a world that I designed and populated with NPCs, items, and functional events.

              "<a href="https://namija.itch.io/caged-beasts-browser-version" target="_blank">Caged Beasts</a>" started as an itch.io October RPGMaker Game Jam that I undertook with a friend and fellow Dartmouth student. We divided the work between us with my teammate writing the story, me designing the maps and incorporating everything into RPGMakerMV, and both of us collaborating on the chase scenes and puzzles. Of the content, I designed the hedge garden chase scene, the werewolf chase scene, and the mechanical component puzzle on the first floor. I also sourced plug-ins, sprites and other assets, chose music and sound effects, and animated cutscenes according to my teammate's dialogue and blocking. I have since continued to update/patch the game, including introducing a browser-playable version.

                course I completed in Spring 2022. This RPG was my attempt at making an immersive and historically honest portrayal of the Medieval Japanese epic Tale of the Heike. The demo contains a single dungeon based on a few starting chapters, and showcases puzzles, combat cutscenes, and period architecture and sprites.
